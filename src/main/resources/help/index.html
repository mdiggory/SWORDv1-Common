        <h1>SWORD Demonstration Client</h1>
        <p>This application contains a demonstration client for the 
           SWORD (Simple Web-service Offering Repository Deposit) project. 
           The client is designed to test connections to digital 
           repositories that support the SWORD Protocol 1.3. This client
           does not provide backwards compatibility with the SWORD protocol
           1.2; download version 1.0 of the client if you need to test
           the initial SWORD protocol.
        </p>
        <p>The SWORD Protocol uses a subset of the Atom Publishing 
           Protocol and the Atom Protocol to query a set of deposit 
           services that are available from a repository and to 
           submit (post) files to the repository.
        </p>
        <h2>Requirements</h2>
        <p>The SWORD Client is a Java application. It requires Java 1.5. You can 
           download Java from the <a href="http://java.sun.com/">Java</a> website.
        </p>
        <h2>Client Modes</h2>
        <p>The client supports two modes: </p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><b><a href="cmdClient.html"><b>Command Line</b></a></b> - This is a version that runs as a command line tool, with options to control each of the main functions to access service documents and post files to a repository. </li>
            <li value="2"><b><a href="guiClient.html"><b>GUI</b></a></b> - This is a window based version. This is the default mode if no option is specified to run in command line mode. </li>
        </ul>
